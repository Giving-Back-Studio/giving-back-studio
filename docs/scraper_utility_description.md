# Scraper Utility Description

## Overview

The current scraper utility in our React frontend is a simplified mock implementation that doesn't actually scrape websites. Instead, it returns predefined data for demonstration purposes. However, this document will describe how a real scraper utility could work, which you can use as a basis for implementing a Python backend version.

## Structure

The scraper utility is organized into three main functions:

1. `scrapeReFiInvestors()`
2. `scrapeTech4GoodJobs()`
3. `scrapePermacultureFarms()`

Each function is responsible for scraping data from different sources related to its specific category.

## Functionality

In a real implementation, each function would:

1. Make HTTP requests to relevant websites
2. Parse the HTML content of the pages
3. Extract the required information
4. Format the data into a consistent structure

### Data Structure

Each scraped item typically includes:

- `id`: A unique identifier
- `name`: The name of the investor, job, or farm
- `description`: A brief description
- `link`: A URL to more information

## Implementation Details

Here's a pseudo-code representation of how each function might work in a real scraper:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_refi_investors():
    url = "https://example-refi-investor-site.com"
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    investors = []
    for investor_element in soup.find_all('div', class_='investor-card'):
        investor = {
            'id': investor_element['data-id'],
            'name': investor_element.find('h2').text,
            'description': investor_element.find('p', class_='description').text,
            'link': investor_element.find('a')['href']
        }
        investors.append(investor)
    
    return investors

# Similar functions would be implemented for tech4good jobs and permaculture farms
```

## Error Handling

In a robust implementation, each function should include error handling for:

- Network errors
- Parsing errors
- Rate limiting

## Caching

To improve performance and reduce load on the scraped websites, implement a caching mechanism. Store scraped data with a timestamp and only re-scrape after a certain time period has elapsed.

## Ethical Considerations

When implementing a real scraper:

1. Respect robots.txt files
2. Implement rate limiting to avoid overloading target websites
3. Consider reaching out to website owners for permission or to inquire about API access

## Integration with Frontend

The Python backend should expose API endpoints that the React frontend can call to retrieve the scraped data. This allows for separation of concerns and better scalability.
